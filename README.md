# Emotion Classification in Texts

## **Goal**  
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of **automatically classifying emotions** in text data. The model is trained on a dataset of texts labeled with one of six emotion categories:

- sadness (0)  
- joy (1)  
- love (2)  
- anger (3)  
- fear (4)  
- surprise (5)

## **Project Description**  

The project involved building a model to classify six basic emotions in text. The workflow included **data preprocessing, tokenization, model training**, and **evaluation of different architectures**.

Several approaches were explored using **Python** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, including **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)**, and **transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT).

The final product is a tool that enables **automatic recognition of the dominant emotion** in any given text input.
